# Prisma ORM
## Description

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a software architectural pattern that separates the concerns of reading data (queries) from modifying data (commands) in an application. It promotes a clear separation between the models and mechanisms used for reading data and those used for writing data.
